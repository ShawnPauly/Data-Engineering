RULES AND RESTRICTIONS:

Group BY Function:
Group by function used to group the data based upon the aggregrate value.

ORDER EXECUTION:
FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
SELECT
ORDER BY


SELECT order_date, count(*) as total_count
FROM orders
where order_status in ('COMPLETE','CLOSED')
GROUP BY order_date
ORDER BY order_date desc;


Above code is explained in compiler version:

1. Based upon the above code, the query will execute the from clause first and stored the data in the memory.
2. Then where clause will be executed based upon the condition provided(in our case we are checking the status of completed and closed)
3. Where clause cannot use the Alias in the select statement as the order of execution of select is after group by.
4. When Group by is there where clause cannot use aggregarte function.
5. Once the Where clause is executed then the group by will be triggered.
6. Group by checks the select statement for aggregrate value and group column.
7. Order by clause reorders the data into expected order.
